Lab 2 Questions:

You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:

  • Which device acts as the client?
  Bob’s computer acts as the client because it initiates the request for content.

  • Which device acts as the server?
  GitHub’s web servers web server acts as the server because it stores, processes, and delivers the requested content back to the client (mine or Bob's computer).

  • How Bob’s browser requests the repository content?
  When Bob enters the repository’s URL in his browser, the browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server’s IP address, specifying what resource Bob is trying to access
(a web page, file, or repository data).

  • How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob?
  The server receives the request from Bob's computer, processes it, and locates the requested content. Then, it sends back an HTTP/HTTPS response, which includes the resource (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data files). Bob’s browser interprets this response and displays the content on his screen.

My name is Kateryna Kravchenko. I was born and raised in Ukraine. I earned a Master’s degree in Journalism and worked as a journalist and screenwriter for almost ten years. I moved to Canada about three years ago and decided to change my career path. Currently, I’m studying Interaction Design at Capilano University, and I’m looking forward to continuing my journey as a UX/UI designer.
